# LIP12005-emotion
Repository for the project "Comparing Approaches for Emotion Recognition from Text".

This repository contains all the code used in the project for preparing the data, building and eveluating the models. This should be sufficient for recreating all my work. See the references and footnotes in the report for where to find my sources.

(The trained models themselves are not included. I can retrain them on request, but note that performances may differ.)
